                Major cultural events of the Majuli are an integral part of the life of the people. Seasonal variations and celebration of festivals are correlated. This has a direct impact on the activities and occupation pattern of people of the Majuli. The Sattras are the major centers where the local people assemble in large numbers for the celebration of festivals. These are the occasions when people get united and perform the rituals along with the Sattradhikar and the bhaktas. These are times when people get spiritually and rejuvenated by following the practices. It gives them a better understanding of the Vaishnavite principles and philosophy.<br><br>

Another aspect of the celebration of festivals is related to the farming practices. The Sattras give equal importance to these festivals. These are also occasions when the villagers and the Sattradhikar along with the bhaktas come together to celebrate the event.<br><br>

Hence, the Sattras give equal importance to religious events and farming practices and the same ideology is transmitted to the villagers as well, as they are their followers.<br>

    Following are the festivals celebrated in the river island of Majuli:-

<b>1.FALGUTSAV:</b> Falgutsav, Doul Yatra, or more commonly, Phakuwa is a festival of colour stated to have played at Lord Krishna's birth place at Gokula between Krishna and the gopis. In some of the borgeets also Shankaradeva and Madhavdeva have narrated how Lord Krishna played with color, rang or ahira with his fellow friends. As this festival is observed in the month of Phaguna (Feb-March), it has been called falgutsav. This festival is observed both in the Sattras as well as in the villages to celebrate spring season when nature is full of resources which could be used to prepare for the difficult times in future. On the full moon day of the Indian month of Phaguna the image of Krishna, popularly known as Dol- Govinda is taken seven times around a holy fire and installed on a swing. This festival lasts for three days. On the afternoon of the third day, the image is taken out in a temple like house (dual) in a procession to the adjoining areas. The term Doul Yatra is derived from this procession. During the travel of the image of the Lord villagers in the neighbourhood come out to the streets and offer prayer along with some dakshina and other articles. It is sated that falgutsav was first introduced by Shankaradeva himself in the Bardowa Than, Shankaradeva's birth place, and then at Barpeta Sattra. When the procession returns a mock fight takes place between people with coloured water being sprinkled on each other by people. After which the image is installed back in its original place. This mock fight also commemorates the colourful spring and the happy environment. The colour used is an antidote to pox. Falgutsav is also known as Fakuwa or holi. Repair work of boats and thatched roofs take place in the Sattras and in the villages. Craft work like making hand fan with cane, bamboo basket and boats starts due to the availability of materials and for their extensive use in the rainy season.

    <b></b>2.BIHU:</b> Bihu is the national festival of Assam. There are three Bihus in Assam held in three different times of the year, perhaps fixed according to the urge of early human habit in a particular topographical context. They are Bohag Bihu, Kati Bihu and Magh Bihu. The first is observed in the middle of April, the second at the close of the Hindu month of Asvin or Ashin and beginning of Kartik or Kati (middle of October), while the third is observed at the close of the Hindu month of Pausha or Puh and beginning of Magh (middle of January). Of the three Bihus, the Bohag Bihu also called Rangali Bihu is the most popular and widespread over all sections of the people irrespective of caste and religion having a secular character. The popularity of this festival among the various communities and its composite character with the folk and spiritual elements of the society. The Bohag Bihu is marked by bathing and feeding of the cows, reading of the verses from the religious scriptures reflecting the activities of Lord Krishna, use of Khol and organization of the smaran-kirtan. There is an organization of the congregation prayer at the village namghar on sankranti day (first day of the Bihu). This is celebrated for three to seven days commencing on the last day of the Chaitra month of the Indian calendar. On this day, leaves and vegetables are fed to the domestic animals like cow etc. in belief of their well being. Then the animals are washed with turmeric and mati mah (pulse) as they are considered to be antibiotics. The cowshed is besmeared with thick smoke created by burning a heap of husks, grass and a special kind of herb called makhiyati, believed to burn the mosquitoes and other insects, and thereby contribute towards the good health and breeding of the animals. This whole procedure is actually geared towards preparing the animals for the forthcoming cropping season (Xali paddy). The second day of the celebration is the first day of a new year. It is celebrated by performing the Bihu dance wearing clothes of Muga silk and playing Dhol and playing of bamboo instruments like gagana, taka and buffalo-horn called pepa. The dance signifies new life and hope and was originally performed in the fields to symbolize the fertile and productive nature of the earth and the accompanying songs reflected different facets of life. Bihu teams consisting of young and male members of the village go from house to house, singing huchari kirtan (a kind of congregation singing /chorus), and performing the Bihu dance. They bless the householder and collect whatever amount of dakshina (contribution) he could offer to the team. It is customary that the dakshina should include a piece of gamocha (an Assamese towel) since a symbol of gifting of a piece of cloth (bastra dan) is considered of great religious merit.17 It is customary to eat rare varieties of pot herbs (xak in Assamese) during the celebration of Rongali Bihu. Different varieties of pancakes and confectionaries made out of coconut, sesame seeds, jaggery, rice powder, sticky rice, and milk products are prepared in a traditional way. Amongst some ethnic communities, brewing of rice beer and preparation of pork and chicken is a must.<br>

        <b></b>3.ALI AI LIGANG (MISHING):</b> Among the most widely popular festivals of the Mishings having both religious and secular tone is the one called by them as Ali-Aye-Lrigang, the spring festival observed on the first Wednesday of the month of Phagun at the beginning of the spring season. It is the national festival of the Mishings to be equated with the Bohag Bihu of the others. The term Ali-Aye-Lrigang means the festival of sowing seeds; ali means paddy, seed or root called alu; aye means fruit, and Lrigang means the day of sowing seeds. The entire term means the day of sowing seeds. On the first Wednesday, the Mishing perform religious ceremonies related to agriculture. Early in the morning the members of a Mishing family go to the field under the leadership of the mother or the head woman of a family who transplants some rice according to their hill practices at the corner of the field. After this they offer their prayers to "guingsomin", "donyi-polo" and then commence cultivation. The festival is celebrated by consuming and offering fish, meat and cake made of bara rice. For that purpose, a fish and meat collection drive is undertaken collectively by the whole village using knifes and other iron and bamboo implements. Ali Aye Ligang is popularly called by the non- Mishings as Mishing Bihu. And gumrag, the most distinguished of the dance forms of the Mishings which depicts the various activities in their daily life dominates the whole festival. The movements in this dance enhance the text they accompany. Magh Bihu is celebrated on the day of the makar sankranti (mid-january) when the sun enters the northern solar sphere. This festival is also known as Bhogali Bihu which means festival of eating. The harvesting is over by then and there is plenty to eat. The Magh Bihu is significant as first, it is celebrated at the close of the season of harvesting of the winter crops: bao mainly, and Xali paddy and second, it is the season of availability of all sorts of food items: milk, curd, cream, rice, fish, pulses, gur etc. Thus, after harvesting it is time for recreation and feeding. But this being the season of cold, the major way of celebrating it is to make heaps of firewood, or dry paddy straw called nara and make a fire called meji in open or in the paddy fields and to arrange grand feasts on the night before maker sankranti called uruka. Various kinds of cake (pitha) and breakfast items (jalpan) are prepared by the villagers. The next day, people gather at the village namghar and perform congregational prayers. In some of the villages people arrange a grant feast on that day. This Bihu is not popular among the tribal communities in Majuli. While the villagers celebrate it with bonfires and feasts, the Sattras observe it with congregational prayers and music. A grass rope is tied around the bigger trees with canonical hymns written on the leaves to prevent damage to the fruit bearing trees. Food prepared from the newly harvested crop is offered Namghar. People of Majuli observe the Kati Bihu on the Ahin-Kati Sankranti day. It is also called Kangali i.e. poor. The season of October-November is one of scarcity particularly in Majuli. The season of rain has just ended, paddy fields are green but not yet brown, domestic animals are yet very thin having passed the flood season with lack of grazing areas leading to scarcity of milk and milk products and sugarcanes are not yet mature for making gur, and so forth. On the day of Kati Bihu, the basil (tulsi) plant is ceremoniously planted and the offering of light to the plant constitutes the special function of the day. This act of offering light continues throughout the month. In the Sattras of Brahma Sanghati, special installation of light on tall bamboo and cane structures is made. This installation is known as Akash Bati and prayers are held for previous sattradhikars' well being, of people and world peace. This period is actually the time when the paddy plant is fully grown. Hence it attracts a lot of insects and pests. So the Sattras have developed a mandatory ritual of installing Akash Bati. This practice is then followed in the villages as well. Villagers go to the paddy fields in the evening to light candles (batti) praying for God Almighty's grace for good of the harvest and for destruction and of the insects that may destroy crops. It is a custom for the cultivators in the Majuli Island to go to the fields next day to see the growing crops. At noon that day they go to the namghar and organize a congregational prayer i.e. namkirtan, distribute mag-prasad and offer salutation to the God Almighty for the welfare of all.

          <b></b>4.BISU (DEORI):</b> The Bisu of the Deoris begins in the first Wednesday of the (mid-April) month of Bohag. The Bisu is both a secular and a religious festival. Preparations for the Bisu festival are made for the whole month of Chot preceding the festival. The actual festival starts on the first Wednesday of the Bohag month along with the worship of their god Kundi-Mama (Hara-Gauri) with the sacrifice of thirteen fowls at the sal (shrine) of the priest. On the first day the young and old together go to the house of the chief priest and spend the whole night dancing and singing there. The next morning they go to the river and take common bath and also bathe their cattle. Since that day till the next Wednesday the young girls and boys of the village dance and sing at the open Marang house of the Gosani Sal. The Deoris have certain reservations about entering the thanghar. They consider 'dumahi' to be inauspicious. That's why they don't celebrate the sankranti of magh or bohag bihu as done by the general Assamese community. They consider Wednesday or Thursday to be auspicious days. Hence, they consider only the first Wednesday after the magh or bohag sankranti as uruka and only then the Carideoris perform puja in the thanghar.  </p>
