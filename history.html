            The island was a long and slender piece of land, located between two parallel rivers, the Brahmaputra to the north and the Burhidihing to the south, where they converged at a place called Lakhu. Originally, it bore the name Ratnapur and served as the capital of the mighty Sutiya kingdom. In the years between 1661 and 1696,[10] a series of earthquakes in the 17th century set the stage for a massive flood in 1750, which reshaped the region. This flood caused the Brahmaputra to change course, resulting in the formation of Majuli island.[11]</p>
            
            <p>The Ahom king Pratap Singha built a rampart on Majuli called Meragarh in the first half of the 17th century. Lakshmi Singha (Ahom king who reigned from 1769-1780), wrote a grant in 1776 referring to "Majuli pradesh" and its Kamalabari Satra, Agnichapori, Gajala Satra, and the Tuni River. During the Moamaria rebellion, the island was controlled by Howha, a Moamaria rebel leader.[12]</p>
            
            <p>The Burhi Dihing's confluence moved east by 190 km[when?]. The southern channel became the Burhi Xuti, and the northern channel turned into the Luit Xuti. Over time, the Luit Xuti diminished, becoming the Kerkota Xuti, while the Burhi Xuti expanded to become the main Brahmaputra River.[13]
            
               <p> Majuli has been Assamese civilization's cultural hub since the 16th century, connected to the visit of Srimanta Sankardeva, a 16th-century social reformer. Sankardeva, a pioneer of the neo-Vaishnavite movement, preached Vaishnavism and established monasteries called satras on the island.[citation needed]</p>
            
           Majuli became a major hub of Vaishnavism with the establishment of satras. It was under British rule until India gained independence in 1947 and is the world's largest river island..[14]<br>
            
            Over the last 200 years Majuli has shrunk in size as the river surrounding it has grown.[15] In the 1790s, the island covered an area of 1,300 km2 (500 sq mi).[16] It had an area of 1,255 square kilometres (485 sq mi) at the beginning of the 20th century,[17] but, having lost significantly to erosion, it covers only 352 square kilometres (136 sq mi) as of 2014.[18]</p>
            <p>>The island was a long, narrow piece of land called Majoli (land in the middle of two parallel rivers) that had the Brahmaputra flowing in the north and the Burhidihing flowing in the south until they met at Lakhu. It was once known as Ratnapur and was the capital of the powerful Chutia kingdom. Frequent earthquakes in the period 1661–1696 set the stage for a catastrophic flood in 1750 that continued for 15 days, which is mentioned in historical texts and reflected in folklore. As a result of this flood, part of the Brahmaputra discharged southward into what was the Burhidihing's lower channel and Mājuli island was formed.<br>

            The Burhidihing's point of confluence moved 190 km east and the southern channel which was the Burhidihing became the Burhi Xuti. The northern channel, which was previously the Brahmaputra, became the Luit Xuti. In due course, the flow in the Luit Xuti decreased, and it came to be known as the Kerkota Xuti; and the Burhi Xuti expanded via erosion to become the main Brahmaputra River. The locals speak in Assamese and Mising language mainly. A few speak in the Deori language as well. Mājuli has been the cultural capital of Assamese civilisation since the 16th century; based on written records describing the visit of Srimanta Sankardeva — a 16th-century social reformer. Sankardeva, a pioneer of the medieval-age neo-Vaishnavite movement, preached a monotheist form of Hinduism and Vaishnavism and established monasteries and hermitages known as satras on the islet.<br>
            
            The island soon became the leading center of Vaishnavinism with the establishment of these satras. After the arrival of the British, Majuli was under the rule of the British until India gained independence in 1947. It is as of 2016 the world's biggest river island</p>
